Alert brokers
#############

Find more information about the nine alert brokers and how to access them in the `Rubin Observatory For Scientists <https://rubinobservatory.org/for-scientists/data-products/alerts-and-brokers>`_ website.

**Alert broker:** Software systems that ingest and process astronomical alerts from the LSST and other surveys, and serve them to the scientific community.

**Alert filter:** A set of rules that an alert packet either passes or fails.
E.g., "if brighter than 21st magnitude, and if discovered less than 6 days ago, and if two detections exist, then pass" would be is a very simple filter.

Community filters
=================

Up to 20 community alert filters will be defined, implemented, validated, and maintained by Rubin staff with input from the broad Rubin science community, and with support from the ANTARES broker.

These community filters will be designed to serve a variety of common time-domain science goals, and lower the barrier to entry into alert-based science.

See the "Roadmap for Community Alert Filters with the ANTARES Broker" `RTN-090 <https://rtn-090.lsst.io/>`_.
