Placeholder dates for orbit records
===================================

As of Thu Feb 26 2026: In SS alerts, the ``mpc_orbits`` record fields ``created_at``, ``updated_at``, and ``fitting_datetime`` are filled with placeholder values ``1970-01-01``.
This is temporary, with a permanent fix expected in coming weeks.
