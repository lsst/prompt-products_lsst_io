Solar System Processing includes both the association of known Solar System Objects (SSOs) during nighttime observations as well as the discovery of new SSOs by linking unassociated ``DiaSources`` during daytime processing.
All Rubin SSO observations and discoveries are reported to the Minor Planet Center (MPC).
