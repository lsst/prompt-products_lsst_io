The orbit catalog produced by the `Minor Planet Center <https://minorplanetcenter.net/>`_ (MPC).

Schema: TBD

The MPCORB catalog is not yet accessible.

The MPC has assigned `"observatory code" <https://minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/ObsCodesF.html>`_ ``X05`` to the Rubin Observatory.


Description
===========

The `Minor Planet Center <https://minorplanetcenter.net/>`_ (MPC) is the single worldwide location for receipt and distribution of positional measurements of small bodies.
The MPC is responsible for the identification, designation, and orbit computation for all of these objects.

The ``MPCORB`` table contains the orbital parameters calculated by the MPC for all known solar system objects and the linked difference-image detections of moving objects submitted by Rubin.

Processing
----------

The MPCORB catalog is the result of :doc:`/processing/moving/index`.
